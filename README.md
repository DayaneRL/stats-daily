CoreUI is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The CoreUI Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – CoreUI covers them all!

## Support CoreUI Development

CoreUI is an MIT-licensed open source project and is completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support development by buying the [CoreUI PRO](https://coreui.io/pricing/?framework=react&src=github-coreui-free-react-admin-template) or by becoming a sponsor via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/coreui/).
